-1.0.2 - Made changes to the following pages:
HTML: 
Renamed - original Index to usersadmin.html - Dont need usersadmin, everything can be done on db for now. Lets focus on userside.
Renamed - details to userdetails.html
Created - dashboard.html for main dashboard landing pages - Please see notes below.
Index page to become login page for the application - Happy here will get this working..

reneders: 
    Updated renderers to point to new pages as above.

CSS: 
    Added new menu structure to be followed over the whole application. 

File Movements: Moved this file to main Directory

Notes:

    I would like a main menu on the side:
                Add Order
                Recieve Stock
                View Job Tickects
                Settings
                Exit

    dashboard.html :
        We will hide the context menu as its not needed.
        The dashboard screen must have the backorder table on display.
            With this I would like a search option on top, would like to also select what im using to search with a drop down maybe?

        We will add a timer to refresh data - Discussion from last night
        Each line will be clickable to edit record, except the job card number field. This should display the whole order. 

    Add Order Page: I will try show what I want here, as we will need to add several lines at a time but increment the order in a way,
                !! Bonus for later we will try OCR here.
